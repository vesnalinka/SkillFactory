### Description of the project
Guess the random number taken by PC with minimum attempts

**Competitive environment:**
- Computer takes an interger in range from 0 to 100 and we have to guess it. By 'guess' we imply 'create the program which guesses the number'
- The algorythm takes in consideration the information whether the number is greater or smaller than the one we are guessing.

**Quality metrics**
Results are evaluated by the mean of attempts in 1000 repeats

**What we practice**
- Learning to make good Python code
- Learning to work with IDE
- Learning to work with GitHub
